## Enemy Types

- **Drone** (Red): Basic enemy, flies straight at you

- **Bomber** (Dark): Fires projectiles at YOU - high priority target

## Tips

- Prioritize **Bombers** - their projectiles damage your hull
- Save **Missiles** for Shielded enemies or groups
- Use **Shockwave** when overwhelmed - it damages everything
- Let your weapon cool down to avoid overheat lockout
- Watch the tier announcements - new enemy types appear over time

## Troubleshooting

- **Jittery cursor**: Ensure good lighting and steady hand position
- **Wrong gestures detected**: Re-run calibration from pause menu
- **Hand not detected**: Keep hand within camera frame, fingers visible
- **Performance issues**: Close other browser tabs, ensure hardware acceleration is on
