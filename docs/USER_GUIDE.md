# User Guide

The application is currently a placeholder shell for the rebuild effort. There is no gameplay, camera access, or gesture input
in this version. Use it to preview the screens where future features will land.

## What you can do
- Open the app and click through the phase list (foundation, calibration, ready/menu, gameplay) to view placeholder guidance.
- Read the notes on each screen to understand what will be built next.

## What you cannot do yet
- Play the game, shoot targets, or see enemies.
- Use a webcam or gestures (MediaPipe support will return in later phases).
- Interact with Three.js scenes or HUD overlays.

This guide will expand once the rebuilt input, rendering, and gameplay systems are added.
